<h1>UDP Receive</h1>
<h3>Library</h3>
<span style="font-family: Courier New">GenericTarget / Interface / UDP Receive</span>

<h3>Description</h3>
Receive UDP messages at the specified port. The communication is handled via a global internal socket that must be bound to a unique port.
All UDP blocks access that internal socket via the port, which is specified under the socket tab.
During simulation via Simulink the port should be globally unique among all UDP blocks, because there's no global internal socket but a
local one for each block.


<h2>Output Ports</h2>
<h3>bytes</h3>
An N-by-M matrix containing the messages that have been received, where N indicates the buffer size for a single message and M denotes
the number of messages in the buffer.
<br>
<b>Data Type:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New">uint8</span>

<h3>length</h3>
An M-by-1 vector indicating the actual length of the corresponding message. M denotes the number of messages in the buffer.
<br>
<b>Data Type:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New">uint32</span>

<h3>details</h3>
This output port is enabled, when checking the option <b>Show details output port</b> via the block mask.
<br>
<b>Data Type:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New">Bus</span>
<br><br>
The bus contains the following values.

<h3>Socket</h3>
A socket represents the programming interface from the application to the network hardware.
During the initialization phase of the model, all UDP blocks register with the generic target core, which manages all sockets in a hash table.
A socket is uniquely identified by its local port.
This port serves as the key value for the internal hash table.
If several UDP blocks register with the same port, then these blocks are linked to the same socket.
All UDP blocks that use the same local port thus always access the same socket.
All other settings that can be made in a block mask always refer to the socket that belongs to the specified port.
If, for example, two different interface addresses are specified for the same socket, then the generic target core reports an error and the software terminates.

<div class="note-green">
<h3 class="note-green">Note</h3>
Only one UDP receive block should be used for a socket.
At the same time several UDP Send blocks can be used for the same socket.
While the UDP receive block outputs all received messages from the buffer in the executed sample step, a message is sent immediately when the UDP send block is executed.
If multiple receivers are registered for the same port, then the generic target core reports an error and the software terminates.
</div>

<h3>Port Range</h3>
The port range [0,1023] is reserved for system ports and should not be used.
The range [1024,49151] is defined for user ports.
The remaining range [49152,65536] is reserved for dynamic ports.
However, not all operating systems follow this standardization.
Under certain circumstances, ports in the dynamic ports range may not be able to be used explicitly because the operating system prevents this.
If a port cannot be bound, then this port is either in use by another program or the operating system prevents its use.

<div class="note-orange">
<h3 class="note-orange">Application Port</h3>
Keep in mind that the target application uses its own port (<a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#portAppSocket">portAppSocket</a>) to prevent the target from being started multiple times.
This port is set via the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> class and cannot be used again in the model.
</div>

<h3>Buffering</h3>
Each socket has its own thread in which the data is received.
All received messages are collected in a software buffer.
The maximum number of messages is set with the <code>maxNumMessages</code> parameter.
Each message in the buffer has a maximum number of bytes, which is set with the <code>rxBufferSize</code> parameter.
If the buffer is full and more messages are received, then either the received message or the oldest message is deleted from the buffer, depending on which rule is set with the <code>bufferStrategy</code> parameter.
In each sampling step in which the receive block is executed, the entire buffer with all messages is read out and made available at the outputs of the block.
The buffer is then cleared.
The actual number of received messages is defined by the output <code>numReceivedMessages</code>.
The <code>numDiscardedMessages</code> output indicates how many messages were discarded, for example because more messages were received than could be stored in the software buffer.
