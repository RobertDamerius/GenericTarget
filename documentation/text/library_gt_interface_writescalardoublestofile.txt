<span style="font-family: Courier New">GenericTarget / Interface / Write Scalar Doubles To File</span>

<h3>Description</h3>
Write a bus signal of scalar doubles to a file. During simulation this block has no effect. Internally,
a digital clock is used as timestamp. The number of samples to be written into one file can be specified.
A sample indicates a vector of values including the time and all signals in the bus.


<h2>Input Ports</h2>
<h3>bus</h3>
A bus that must contain only nested busses and scalar values for type <code>double</code>.


<h2>Block Parameters</h2>
The following table shows all block parameters.
<table>
    <tr><th>Parameter Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td style="font-family: Courier New;">strID</td><td>Unique ID for this data recording.</td></tr>
    <tr><td style="font-family: Courier New;">numSamplesPerFile</td><td>The maximum number of samples per data recording file.</td></tr>
    <tr><td style="font-family: Courier New;">SampleTime</td><td>Sampletime.</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Bus Structure</h3>
The bus must contain only nested busses and scalar values for type <code>double</code>.
Everytime the Simulink model is updated, a callback function reads out the entire structure of the bus, including signal names.
From this information this block will be adjusted internally, selecting all signals from the bus and serializing them.

<h3>Unique ID</h3>
The data is uniquely identified by an ID via the block mask.
An ID may only occur once in the model.
The ID corresponds to a string, which is finally used for the file name of the recording file.

<h3>Data Recorder</h3>
In the generic target core a separate thread takes over the actual writing of the data into the recording file.
For each ID a separate thread is created.
All data recording threads have the same priority, which is defined by the parameter <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#priorityDataRecorder">priorityDataRecorder</a> of the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> class.
Via the block mask, the parameter <code>numSamplesPerFile</code> is used to specify how many samples are to be written to a file before a new file is created.
A sample contains a timestamp, which corresponds to the simulation time (digital clock), as well as all values of the bus at this sampling step.
