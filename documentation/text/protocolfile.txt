<h1>Protocol File</h1>
    If the target application is started, the console output is redirected to a text file.
    All protocol files are stored in the <code>protocol/</code> directory in the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#targetSoftwareDirectory">software directory</a> of the target application.
    A protocol file contains information about the target software such as warnings and error messages.
    All messages are time stamped.
    If the application is started with <code>--console</code>, the output is not redirected to a text file.

<h3>Example Protocol File</h3>
    Using the MATLAB class <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> the current protocol file is displayed:
    <pre>target.ShowLatestProtocol();    % target is a GT.GenericTarget object</pre>
    The content of a protocol file looks like this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><object data="../img/TextLog.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object></center>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h3>Section 1</h3>
    This area displays application information, such as the generic target version, the name of the deployed Simulink model, when it was compiled, when it was started, and so on.
    Some detailed information about the target model, such as priorities, sampletimes, etc., are also shown.


    <h3>Section 2</h3>
    The type of message is displayed at the beginning of a line.
    No character here means that it is information.
    An 'E' means error, a 'W' means warning.
    In this example, there're no errors or warnings.


    <h3>Section 3</h3>
    Specifies the timestamp.
    This time refers to the start time of the application.


    <h3>Section 4</h3>
    Messages during the initialization phase.


    <h3>Section 5</h3>
    The application has received a termination message.
    In this case the application was stopped by calling the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#Stop">Stop</a> member function of the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> MATLAB class.


    <h3>Section 6</h3>
    The termination phase of the application.
