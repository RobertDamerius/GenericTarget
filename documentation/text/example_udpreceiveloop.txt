<h1>Suggested Procedure for UDP Reception</h1>
    In the <b>UDP Receive</b> block, all messages are fetched from the operating systemâ€™s receive buffer, and only the last message is output.
    Since it cannot be guaranteed that the last message corresponds to the expected message, it is advisable to evaluate all messages in the buffer.
    To achieve this, place the <b>UDP Receive</b> block inside a <b>While Iterator</b> subsystem, and disable the "fetch all messages from the network buffer" option in the block mask of the Receive block.

    <p>
    An example of a <b>While Iterator</b> subsystem can be found in the Simulink library under <code>GenericTarget/Examples/UDP Receive Loop</code>.
    This example provides a template for a receive loop.
    The gray area in the template should be replaced with a block that unpacks the actual message.
