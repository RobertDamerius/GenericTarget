<h1>Suggested procedure for UDP reception</h1>
    With the UDP Receive block, all messages are fetched from the operating system's receive buffer and the last message is output.
    As it cannot be guaranteed that the last message in the buffer corresponds to the expected message, it makes sense to evaluate all messages from the buffer.
    To do this, the UDP Receive block must be placed in a While Iterator subsystem and the "fetch all messages from the network buffer" option must be disabled in the block mask of the Receive block.

    <br>
    An example of the content of a While Iterator subsystem can be found in the Simulink library under <code>GenericTarget/Examples/UDP Receive Loop</code>.
    This example provides a template for a receive loop.
    The gray area must be replaced by a block that unpacks the actual message.
