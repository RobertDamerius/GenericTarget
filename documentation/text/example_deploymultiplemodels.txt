<h1>Deploy Multiple Models</h1>
    If multiple models are to be deployed on the same target computer, then a separate <a href="application.html#directory">application directory</a> must be defined for each model.
    If these real-time applications are to run in parallel at the same time, then the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#portAppSocket">application socket</a> of each application must have a unique UDP port.
    In this example, two target applications are to run on the target computer.
    The two Simulink models are named <code>Model1</code> and <code>Model2</code> and are to be deployed on the target into the directories <code>Software1</code> and <code>Software2</code> of the home directory, respectively.
    At the same time, the applications are to be given different names <code>Application1</code> and <code>Application2</code> in this example, so that they can be kept apart in the process manager.
    For each simulink model that is to be deployed to the target, a deployment script is created.

    <br><br>
    <h3>Script 1: Deployment of Model1</h3>
<pre>% Create a target object
username = 'user';
address  = '192.168.0.100';
target   = GT.GenericTarget(userName, address);

% Update properties
target.portAppSocket           = 44001;
target.targetSoftwareDirectory = '~/Software1/';
target.targetProductName       = 'Application1';

% Deploy the model
target.Deploy('Model1');
</pre>

    <br>
    <h3>Script 2: Deployment of Model2</h3>
<pre>% Create a target object
username = 'user';
address  = '192.168.0.100';
target   = GT.GenericTarget(userName, address);

% Update properties
target.portAppSocket           = 44002;
target.targetSoftwareDirectory = '~/Software2/';
target.targetProductName       = 'Application2';

% Deploy the model
target.Deploy('Model2');
</pre>

The real applications are not synchronized in time during execution. Each application runs with its own timing.
The timer events of one target application are not synchronized with the timer events of other target applications.
