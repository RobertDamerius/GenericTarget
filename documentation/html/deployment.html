<h1>Deployment Overview</h1>
    A MATLAB/Simulink model can be created based on the Simulink model template.
    Using the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> MATLAB class, the Simulink model can be brought to the target computer.
    Generic C/C++ code is generated from the Simulink model.
    The generated code essentially contains a class with the methods <code>initialize()</code>, <code>step()</code>, and <code>terminate()</code>.
    The name of the generated class is based on the name of the Simulink model.
    Besides the generated code, the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file is created during the model code generation.
    This file contains additional information such as sampletimes, thread priorities, and function names.
    Based on this information and the properties of the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> class object, the interface code is generated.
    The programming interface from the actual generic target software to this interface is always the same.
    All sources are copied to the target via SCP and are compiled on the target computer afterwards.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Use the MATLAB class GT.GenericTarget</h3>
    For an automatic deployment mechanism, it is useful to write a MATLAB script or function.
    First, a <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> instance must be created.

    <pre>target = GT.GenericTarget('username','hostname');</pre>
    The IP address of the target computer can be specified as host name.
    Afterwards the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#properties">properties</a> of the object can be adjusted if necessary.
    Using the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#Deploy">Deploy</a> method, a Simulink model can then be transferred to the target computer:
    <pre>target.Deploy('modelname');</pre>

<h2>Deployment Process</h2>
    The deployment process consists of two parts.
    First, the code for the whole realtime application is generated.
    Then the code is copied to the target computer and compiled there.
    The individual steps are shown below.
    The generated zip-archive, which contains the generated code for the target, has the same name as the model.
    Here it is called MODELNAME.zip.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><object data="../img/BuildAndDeploy.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object></center><br><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="note-blue">
    <h3 class="note-blue">Note on code generation</h3>
    If only the code is to be generated (blue area, steps 1 to 9), the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#GenerateCode">GenerateCode</a> member function can be used.
    </div>

    <h3>1. Copy Generic Target Core</h3>
    A temporary code generation folder is created that is going to contain the generated application software.
    At the beginning the generic target core is copied into this temporary release folder.
    The Makefile for compiling is updated according to the properties of the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> class.

    <h3>2. slbuild</h3>
    Generic C/C++ code is generated from the Simulink model.
    The model must be configured to use the pack-and-go functionality of MATLAB/Simulink.
    The generated code is generated together with all necessary Simulink libraries in a compressed zip archive (PackNGo.zip).

    <h3>3. Unzip PackNGo.zip</h3>
    The archive is unpacked into the temporary release folder.

    <h3>4. Remove main() Entry Functions</h3>
    All files containing a <code>main()</code> function are removed.
    The strings <code>"int_T main("</code> and <code>"int main("</code> are searched for.
    The generic target core has its own <code>main()</code> function.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #f00;">
    The automatic generation of a main entry function cannot be disabled for the grt.tlc target file under Simulink.
    There is the possibility that other MATLAB versions generate different prototypes!
    </span>
    <div class="note-red">
    <h3 class="note-red">Important</h3>
    All source and header files, that contain <code>int_T main(</code> or <code>int main(</code> are removed!
    It is not examined whether these expressions are part of a comment or not.
    As soon as one of the expressions appears within a file, this file is removed!
    </div>

    <h3>5. Replace RTW Headers</h3>
    All header files named <code>rtw_windows.h</code> and <code>rtw_linux.h</code> are replaced by header files of the same name, which are located in the <code>packages/+GT/Templates/</code>
    directory of the toolbox. In these header files the usage of semaphores and mutexes is defined.
    A semaphore or mutex is used to ensure data integrity during parallel read or write accesses to resources by different threads.
    The generated code often includes <code>rtw_windows.h</code>, even if the code is generated for a Linux target.
    For this reason both headers are functionally identical and use <code>std::mutex</code> as mutex.
    <code>std::mutex</code> is standard since C++11 (platform independent).
    POSIX-semaphores are still used as semaphores.
    The source files <code>rtw_windows.c</code> and <code>rtw_linux.c</code> are also deleted.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #f00;">
    There is a possibility that other MATLAB versions generate different headers or that the source code structure on the MATLAB side changes!
    </span>

    <h3>6. Load codeInfo.mat</h3>
    At this point, the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file created during the slbuild step is loaded.
    This file contains additional information about the generated code such as sampletimes and thread priorities.

    <h3>7. Generate Interface Code</h3>
    Based on the information in the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file, the Simulink interface class is created.
    Additional properties set via the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html">GT.GenericTarget</a> class are also integrated into the Simulink interface class.
    A template of the Simulink interface class is located in the <code>packages/+GT/Templates/</code> directory of the toolbox.
    Special entries marked by $ characters are replaced by corresponding values during the code generation of this Simulink interface class.

    <h3>8. Add Custom Code</h3>
    Additional code, which is set via the <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#customCode">customCode</a> property is added to the temporary release folder.
    All files and folders are copied without checking their content.

    <h3>9. Compress to MODELNAME.zip</h3>
    The temporary release folder now contains the whole application source code that must be compiled to create the generic target realtime application.
    From the template folder a zip archive (MODELNAME.zip) is generated at this point.

    <div class="note-orange">
    <h3 class="note-orange">SSH/SCP</h3>
    MATLAB does not currently have an SSH or SCP client.
    Although it is possible to transfer data to MATLAB via FTP, SSH is required to execute commands anyway.
    For this reason, SSH and SCP commands are called with the <code>system()</code> function of MATLAB.
    An SSH and SCP client must be available on the host computer.
    </div>

    <h3>10. SCP: Upload MODELNAME.zip</h3>
    The archive MODELNAME.zip is moved to the home/user directory on the target computer.

    <h3>11. SSH: Unzip</h3>
    The <code>code/</code> and <code>build/</code> <a href="application.html#directory">directory</a> of the generic target application are deleted first.
    The uploaded archive is then unpacked.

    <h3>12. SSH: Build Application</h3>
    The make tool is used to compile the software.
    It uses 8 jobs (8 source code files are compiled in parallel).
