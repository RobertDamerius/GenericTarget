<h1>Timing and Scheduling</h1>
The Generic-Target Toolbox provides several blocks that can be used to determine the current time.
The times are determined by the operating system. The operating system time can in turn be synchronized via an NTP or PTP server.
In addition to the clock time, times relating to the target can also be determined, such as the <a href="library_gt_time_modelexecutiontime.html">Model Execution Time</a>.
Furthermore, the timing status of the target application can be monitored.
This includes <a href="library_gt_time_taskexecutiontime.html">Task Execution Time</a>, <a href="library_gt_time_taskoverloads.html">Task Overloads</a> and <a href="library_gt_time_cpuoverloads.html">CPU Overloads</a>.

<h3 class="note-red">Limited Support for Windows</h3>
CPU overload and lost ticks are not supported for windows operating system. Keep that in mind when deploying a model to a host running windows.
</div>

The target application uses multi-threading. Each sample rate or periodic partition in the Simulink model corresponds to a separate thread.
These worker threads are executed in parallel. The number of threads actually executed in parallel at the same time is
given by the number of CPU cores. Which threads are executed in parallel is decided by the operating system's scheduler.
In the target application there is a hardware timer that generates events at periodic intervals. The period duration
corresponds to the base sample time of the Simulink model. A master thread receives the timer events and distributes
them to the underlying worker threads in a correctly timed manner. Worker threads are always triggered with a multiple
of the base sampling rate. As soon as a worker thread receives the signal from the master thread, it executes the associated
function from the code generation.
<br>
<br>
The following figure shows an example with three worker threads. The events of the hardware timer are symbolized by a red
stopwatch. The master thread runs with the highest priority and receives the timer events. Due to the operating system,
a small latency (in the range of microseconds) elapses before the master thread receives control from the operating
system and can react to the timer event. This latency is not constant.
The generic target application uses a FIFO strategy for scheduling.
If there are several tasks to do, they are processed one after the other.
The following figure shows an example for the case that all worker threads can work at the same time.

<a name="cpuoverload"></a>
<h3>CPU Overload</h3>
The high-priority realtime thread of the base rate scheduler waits for the event of a periodic timer that is set with the specified base sampletime of the model.
Due to operating-system related latency the realtime thread is not able to handle that event immediately but after some short delay. If the timer produced multiple
events but the realtime thread was not able to handle them in time, a lost tick event occurs. In this case, the number of CPU overloads is incremented and the
number of lost ticks is incremented by the number of tick events that have been lost.

<br>
<br>

<a name="taskoverload"></a>
<h3>Task Overload</h3>
The master thread triggers the worker thread. If the worker thread is still working, it misses the event from the master thread and a
lost wakeup occurs. The event from the master thread is lost and the worker thread loses a time step.
The worker thread is only triggered again synchronously with a subsequent event from the master thread if it is not running.
This, if several lost wakeups occur during a step calculation, a corresponding number of step calls are missing.
The master thread detects all lost wakeups and thus recognizes task overloads.

<h3>Scheduling-Policy: FIFO</h3>
How many threads actually run in parallel in reality depends on the CPU cores used.
In principle, the number of threads that can be executed simultaneously in parallel corresponds to the number of CPU cores.
This does not mean that with a 4-core CPU, the model may have a maximum of four different sampletimes.
Only the number of threads working in parallel is limited to four.
The generic target application uses a FIFO strategy for scheduling.
If there are several tasks to do, they are processed one after the other.

<h2>Thread Overview</h2>
There are two threads that are always present.
These are the the BaseRateScheduler and the main thread.
<br>
<br>
<center><object data="../img/Threads.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="../img/Threads.svg"></object></center>
<br>
<br>
The <b>BaseRateScheduler thread</b> has the highest priority (usually 99).
This thread waits for a timer event, which is set periodically with the base sample rate.
Then this thread distributes the event to all worker threads of the model.
<br>
<br>
The <b>main thread</b> executes the <a href="application.html#flowchart">main entry function</a> of the application.
The initialization and termination phases of the generic target application run in this thread.
In the actual <a href="application.html#mainloop">main loop</a> this thread receives messages via the application socket and waits for a termination message.

<br>
<br>
The number of additional threads depends on the Simulink model.
For each sample rate or periodic partition, one additional worker thread is added.
The maximum priority is set via the property <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#upperThreadPriority">upperThreadPriority</a>.
One additional thread is added for each Write To File block.
The priority is specified via the property <a href="packages_gt_generictarget.html#priorityDataRecorder">priorityDataRecorder</a>.
